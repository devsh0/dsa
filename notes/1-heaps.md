### Heap

##### Heap is a nearly complete binary tree whose nodes are obtained from an array.

_fig(a) is the heap formed of elements of the array shown in fig(b)_.

##### Types of Heaps
There are two types of heaps: max and min. A max heap has the largest node 
(i.e.: node containing the highest value) at its root whereas in a min heap, 
the root contains the lowest value in the entire heap. Beside this, min and max heap satisfy 
a more general heap property. In a max heap, a given node _i_ has a value less
than or equal to the value of its parent _p_. In a min heap, a given node _i_ has
a value greater than or equal to the value of its parent _p_. The figure above 
shows a max heap.
